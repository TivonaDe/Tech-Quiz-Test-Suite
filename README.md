  ## Description  
  Tech Quiz Test Suite is a testing suite designed for the Tech Quiz application, ensuring its functionality, reliability, and user experience through rigorous testing. Utilizing both      End-to-End (E2E) and Component testing methodologies with Cypress, this suite verifies every aspect of the quiz lifecycleâ€”from initiating the quiz, answering questions, to viewing        final scores.

  ## Installation  
  To set up and run the Tech Quiz application along with its E2E test suite in development mode, follow these steps:

  Clone the Repository:

  git clone https://github.com/TivonaDe/Tech-Quiz-Test-Suite.git
  
  Navigate to the Project Directory:

  cd Tech-Quiz-Test-Suite

  Install Dependencies:

  npm install
  
  Set Up Environment Variables:

  Create a .env file in the server directory.
  Use the .env.example file as a template, filling in the necessary values.
  cp server/.env.example server/.env
  Build the Application:

  npm run build

  Seed the Database:

  npm run seed
  
  Launch the Application:

  npm run start:dev

  Open Cypress Test Runner:

  npm run cypress

  This will launch the Cypress Test Runner interface where you can run the tests interactively.

  ## Usage  
  Below are steps for using the Tech Quiz and running its tests:

  Access the Application

  Open http://localhost:3000 (or your chosen port) to use the Tech Quiz.
  Running Tests

  Interactive Mode:
  npm run cypress:open
  In the Cypress Test Runner, select E2E (e.g., quiz.cy.js) or Component tests (e.g., Quiz.cy.jsx).
  Headless Mode:
  npm run test
  Executes all tests (E2E and Component) in headless mode.
  Review Test Results

  Cypress offers logs, screenshots, and videos (if enabled) for debugging and analysis.
